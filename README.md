# csds393Project

We plan to design a web application that will allow CWRU students to upload their class notes and view class notes uploaded by others. Notes will be organized by department, class, and creation date. Students can upload, access, and organize notes into their appropriate folders. Professors, teaching assistants and administrators can view notes, remove notes (such as those that violate academic integrity), and create or remove class folders as new courses are created or discontinued. Each note will have a corresponding discussion board page that will allow users to ask questions, discuss, correct, and leave feedback on that particular note.

We will write our frontend in Typescript, using Next.js, React and Tailwind CSS. We will write our backend in Python using FastAPI, and we will use PostgreSQL as our database and object storage solution.

This project will be built by the team effort of omeikeseth@gmail.com, jasonlai682@gmail.com, jst94@case.edu, smb318@case.edu.
